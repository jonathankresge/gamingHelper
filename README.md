# gamingHelper

The purpose of the gaming helper is to provide GameMasters with tools that can help them more effectively run their games.

It is intended to be:
* Quick character management
* Quick access of stored notes for the game
* * Game notes
* * NPC's
* * Bad Guys & Monsters
* Random creation of things
* * loot
* * items
* * spellbooks
* * shops
* * towns
* * etc.

This will hopefully help the GM run a better game and have to think less about what is going on and more about how to run a better game.  The initial focus will be on creating pathfinder characters, since those are what I will be playing the most initially. Future releases will include D&D (3.5, 4, 5) and Hero System.  Others could potentially be created later on, but that's all I play right now.  

The following progression will take place in creating this epic adventure creator:
* Version 0.1 - fully documented API
* Version 0.2 - fully implemented API
* Version 0.3 - Front end skeleton created
* Version 0.4 - Database access created
* Version 0.5 - Able things into the DB
